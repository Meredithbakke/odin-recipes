        <h2>Use this dough to make the pie of your dreams</h2>
        <p>
            Whether it's <a href="./applepie.html">Classic Apple Pie</a>, <a href="./chocolatepie.html">Chocolate Pudding Pie</a>, or a <a href="./pumpkinpie.html">Classic Pumpkin Pie</a>, this dough will compliment any sweet or savory creation. 
            Since it's made entirely with butter, the preparation requires a little forethought and care—chill everything thoroughly, work quickly, be extra careful not to add too much of it 
            and be extra attentive to prevent overworking the dough. Butter may be tricky to work with, but the result is a crust unparalleled in flavour.

        <p>One note: if you don't have a stand mixer, you can make this dough in a food processor or by hand with a pastry blender. Just make sure to freeze all of your tools, no matter which ones you use.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>350g plain flower</li>
            <li>1 generous tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>Large pinch of salt</li>
            <li>225g chilled unsalted butter, cut into 1cm cubes</li>
            <li>About 125ml ice water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white vinegar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the flour, sugar, and	salt in	bowl of	a stand	mixer with the paddle 
                attachment, then freeze	the	whole thing	for	20 minutes (if you can't fit the 
                bowl in	your freezer, then just	freeze the ingredients). Freeze	the	butter and 
                ice	water as well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fit	the	bowl on	the	mixer and turn to the lowest speed.	Add	the	cubed butter, a	few	pieces at a	time, and mix until	the	butter looks like broken walnut	pieces.	
                Distinct bits of butter	lead to	beautiful flakes in	the	dough, so avoid	overmixing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add	the	vinegar in a thin stream. Add just enough water	and	mix	as little as possible until	the	dough barely holds together
                —you'll probably need close	to the entire 125ml. Some shaggy bits are fine.	If you're not sure whether or not the dough needs 
                more water,	stop the mixer and take	a handful of dough in your palm. Squeeze it	hard, then gently try to break it 
                apart. If it crumbles apart	very easily	and	feels very dry,	add	more water.	If it 
                holds together or breaks into a	few	chunks,	you're done.
            </li>
            <li>On the worktop, pull out a long piece of cling film	from the roll but do 
                not	cut	it.	In	a quick, fearless motion, flip the bowl	over onto the cling	film. 
                Remove the bowl, and avoid touching	the	dough. Cut the film	from the roll 
                and, lifting both ends,	use	it to encourage	all	the	dough into a ball. Don't 
                worry if there are a few dry bits—the flour	will evenly	absorb the moisture 
                with time. Twist the film tightly around the dough to form a ball. Use a sharp knife to	cut	the	ball 
                in	half through the film, wrap	each half again	tightly	with film, and press each half into	a disc.	Chill for at least 2 hours or overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
                To freeze unwrapped, prepared dough	for	up to 2 months, double-wrap it in cling	film and then wrap it in aluminium	foil	to	prevent	freezer	burn.
                Allow the dough	to defrost in the refrigerator overnight before using.
