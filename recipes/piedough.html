        <h2>Use this dough to make the pie of your dreams</h2>
        <p>
            Whether it's Classic Apple Pie, Chicken Pot Pie, Chocolate Pudding Pie, or a Classic Pumpkin Pie, this dough will compliment any sweet or savory creation. 
            Since it's made entirely with butter, the preparation requires a little forethought and careâ€”chill everything thoroughly, work quickly, be extra careful not to add too much of it 
            and be extra attentive to prevent overworking the dough. Butter may be tricky to work with, but the result is a crust unparalleled in flavour.

        <p>One note: if you don't have a stand mixer, you can make this dough in a food processor or by hand with a pastry blender. Just make sure to freeze all of your tools, no matter which ones you use.</p>
