        <h2>Simple but decadent</h2>
        <p>This Easy Chocolate Pie is so delicious, but not overly sweet. The recipe is simple, so the hardest part is waiting for it to set! </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 recipe (1 disk) All-Butter Pie Dough</li>
            <li>1 recipe Bittersweet Chocolate Pudding</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Roll, crimp, and freeze a 23cm pie shell as directed on the previous page. Blind bake the shell: line the 
                dough with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake at 220°C for 15 minutes, then reduce 
                heat to 200°C and bake until lightly golden, another 10 to 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the crust from the oven, remove the pie weights or beans and parchment paper, and reduce the heat to 190°C. Return the crust 
                to the oven and continue baking until the bottom of the crust is lightly golden and the outer crust is just starting to brown, another 5 to 10 
                minutes. Watch the crust closely on this final bake, as baking times will vary depending on the oven.
            </li>
            <li>Let the crust cool, then melt 55g of bittersweet chocolate and brush it all over the crust. Let it harden.</li>
            <li>Make 1 recipe Bittersweet Chocolate Pudding, but increase the cornflour to 40g Press cling film onto the top of the 
                pudding to prevent a skin from forming and cool the to room temperature. Spoon the cooled pudding into the prepared crust, 
                cover with cling film, and chill the pie overnight. To serve, top with billowy Vanilla, Chocolate, Coffee, or Caramel Cream.
            </li>
        </ol>
