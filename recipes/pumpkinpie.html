        <h2>Bursting with the flavors of fall,</h2>
        <p>This pumpkin pie is rich, smooth, and tastes incredible with All-Butter Pie Dough and any Scented Cream of your choice.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 recipe (1 disc) chilled All-Butter Pie Dough</li>
            <li>Flour for rolling</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>350ml heavy cream</li>
            <li>425g pumpkin purée</li>
            <li>145g sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt or 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat	the	oven	to	220°C	and	set	a	rack	to	the	centre	position.
            </li>
            <li>Roll	out	the	chilled	dough	on	a	well-floured	board	until	it’s	about	3mm thick	and	30cm	in	diameter.	Wind	it	around	a	lightly	floured	rolling	pin	and pick	it	up.	Place	the	dough	over	a	23cm	pie	tin	and	unroll,	gently	pressing	it into	the	corners	of	the	tin.	Trim	any	excess	dough	with	a	pair	of	scissors,
                leaving	an	overhang	of	about	2cm.	Save	the	trimmings.
                </li>
            <li>Crimp	the	dough	by	rolling	under	itself	so	you	have	a	rolled	cylinder
                that	sits	on	the	rim	of	the	pie	tin.	Work	with	one	hand	inside	the	edge	of	the crust	and	the	other	on	the	outside.	Use	the	index	finger	of	the	inside	hand
                to	push	the	dough	between	the	thumb	and	forefinger	of	your	outside	hand, forming	a	V	shape.	Continue	all	around	the	crust,	spacing	the	Vs	about
                2.5cm	apart.	As	you	crimp,	pull	the	dough	out	just	past	the	edge	of	the	tin.
                It’ll	shrink	back	as	it	bakes.	Patch	any	holes	with	dough	trimmings.	Prick	the dough	all	over	with	a	fork,	then	freeze	for	15	minutes.
                </li>
            <li>Crack	the	eggs	into	a	medium	bowl	and	break	them	up	with	a	whisk.
                Add	the	cream,	pumpkin	purée,	sugar,	salt,	and	spices	to	the	bowl	and	whisk thoroughly	to	combine.	Pour	the	custard	mixture	into	the	frozen	shell.
                </li>
            <li>Bake	at	220°C	for	15	minutes,	then	reduce	heat	to	160°C	and	bake	until the	centre	is	just	barely	set,	about	40	minutes	more.	Allow	to	cool	on	a	wire
                rack	for	an	hour	before	slicing.	Serve	with	Tangy	Whipped	Vanilla, Cinnamon,	or	Caramel	Cream	(here	to	here). </li>
        </ol>
